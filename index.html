<h2>What it is it?</h2>
<p class="answer">The wukslacker is an advanced tool of warfare. <br>Soldiers are able to strike fear into the hearts of
their enemies using this tool of pure destruction. <br>Noone shall survive the wrath of the wukslacker.

<h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
<p class="answer">The wukslacker is a <a href=#expensive>very expensive purchase</a>. A tool of this much power is very expensive as expected. It costs half a kidney and
$20000.

<h2>Holy moly! That's more that my life savings! Why?</h2>
<p class="answer" id="expensive">Well, we use the half a kidney to produce the wukslacker and the $20000 is for the surgery to
extract your kidney. It's not exactly cheap to produce these things you know. It is actually quite
costly. Please do not question it.

<!-- Ma'am, please do not eat the wukslacker -->
